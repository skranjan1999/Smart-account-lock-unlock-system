🔐 Smart Account Lock/Unlock System
📝 Description
The Smart Account Lock/Unlock System is a shell script-based project designed to enhance system security by automating user account management. This script monitors failed login attempts in real-time, dynamically locks user accounts after a set threshold, and automatically unlocks them after a predefined period of inactivity. It is a practical solution for reducing administrative overhead while addressing security challenges in Linux-based systems.

This project demonstrates the power of shell scripting, log file analysis, and process automation to solve real-world problems in system administration.
